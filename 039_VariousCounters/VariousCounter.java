// Use while loops to...
// -Print out every even number from 0 to 100.
// -Print out every number divisible by 76 from 103,436 to 2,000,007
// -Print out every the following cycle of numbers between 1000 and 2000
// --+7, -3, +11, -2.
// --(E.X. 1000, 1007, 1004, 1015, 1013, 1020...)
// --Make sure to print out each number through different loop iterations. In other words, have logic control which action it takes during each loop.
