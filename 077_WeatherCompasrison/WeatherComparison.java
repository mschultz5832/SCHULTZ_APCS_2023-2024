//-Using the Wunderground History tool, create a 2D array of the daily average temperatures on April 1-7 for each year 2015-2020.
-First, print out the average temperature of all 5 years combined.
-Second, print out the average temperature for that week each year.
-Third, print out the average temperature of each day across all years. In other words, average the April 1st temperature across 2019-2023.
-I want 3 seperate methods for each average printing.
